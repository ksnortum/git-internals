# Git Internals

This is a project from [HyperSkill](https://hyperskill.org) that explores the internal file structure of a Git repository.

I have been writing in Kotlin only a few months, so this project may not be very Kotlinesque. I coded as if this project were part of a larger code base with other programmers looking at my code, so readability and reusability were high on my list.

The project as-is is not very useful but may be interesting to students.

### TODO

* Make it more using friendly, loop and exit
* Enter only the first 6 or more of the hash
* Explore how to deal with Git packing
