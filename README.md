# Git Internals

This is a project from [HyperSkill](https://hyperskill.org) that explores the internal file structure of a Git 
repository.

I have been writing in Kotlin only a few months, so this project may not be very Kotlinesque. I coded as if this 
project were part of a larger code base with other programmers looking at my code, so readability and reusability were 
high on my list.

The project as-is is not very useful as it doesn't deal with Git pack-files, but may be interesting to students.

I have added a simple CLI to make navigating the app more user-friendly. 

### TODO
* Explore how to deal with Git pack-files
